# coe-File-converter-for-FPGA-programming
Converts any file to coe format.

For test reasons, sometimes someone needs to pre-load in memory an audio or video file for FPGA HDL testing in Xilinx coe format. Program is written in Visual Basic 2013 for Windows. The interface is self-explaining (see the .jpg file).

The project is posted here and the setup can be done from http://ftp.eta-sys.net/coeConverter/  
Please feel free to use and change it as you wish.
